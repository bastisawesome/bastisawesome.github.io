        <h1>ApplesOS</h1>
        <p>This is probably my largest and most difficult project. As you can likely guess from the name, it is an operating system, built from scratch. That's right, it is build completely from the ground up with no code from other primary operating systems (won't say that all of the code is mine, but a fair chunk of it is). It has been written and rewritten constantly, and is currently on it's 5th remake. While not my favourite project, it is a fun little side project to work on.</p>
        
        <h3>Base</h3>
        <p>The base of ApplesOS (pronounced "apple sauce") is actually not from any major OS, but instead built from several backbones from OSDev wiki. Following a lot of tutorials from there, the backbone of ApplesOS is a mash up of many different ideas that I cut up and threw together to fit my needs. The current version lacks proper user interaction and has been somewhat abandoned, yet again.</p>
