        <h1>ASOS</h1>
        <p><abbr title="Aperture Science Operating System">ASOS</abbr> was my first attempt at making an operating system, and is the basis for <a href='./applesos.html'>ApplesOS</a>. It was actually remade into a Linux simulator and the original build was deleted and restarted. The original design of ASOS was actually done while I was sitting in computer classes where I required the school computers. The program was written on an online Python parser and was an attempt at creating a Linux-like <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI<abbr>. However, the further in I went the more complex the system became, to the point where the online interpreter no longer suited my needs. On a day where I had no internet access and my own laptop, I immediately went to work recreating it from scratch and I managed to get it back to the state it was in after 2 years of development. All of that within 30 minutes.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of ASOS was originally to learn how to write a CLI using a very limited parser, no file system, and a poorly designed website. Surprisingly, it did alright early on. It was a learning experience, mostly. I was learning how to get a Unix-like CLI working, with Linux/Unix commands. It gave me a fair insight on how the commands work, in theory, and how I could modify their behaviour to suit a non-permanent storage solution.</p>
        
        <h3>Early Development</h3>
        <p>Early on, ASOS was just a simple command interpreter. It accepted a command, parsed a bunch of function, then ran the proper function. ASOS originated likely back when I worked with Java, in an attempt to create a Java command line, which ultimately failed and was scrapped. Eventually, though, ASOS took its first form as a Python project, with the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> being written from scratch. After a bit of research I finally found something that would speed up my work with a CLI: the Python <code>cmd</code> module. After about a year of development I still hadn't produced anything nor really knew what my end goal was, I simply knew that I only had access to a command line and that the UI would be completely text based. Finally, in my senior year of high school, I decided that ASOS would take shape as LinEmu (for Linux Emulator), and that became my focus: to create a Linux-like CLI. Oddly enough, it took me a few weeks to finally realise that what I was creating was a simulator, but LinSimu didn't have the ring I wanted, so I maintained the name. At this point, I began to work on commands that had to be "installed" (recall, I didn't have access to a file system), and I very quickly learnt that <code>cmd</code> simply lacked important features. So, I started overwriting the default class methods and started calling commands based on an array of installed commands and an array of installed packages, which could be modified by using the install command. That would read from an array of packages, determine if the packages existed already, then determined the commands that came with the packages. Finally, it would change the installed commands and installed packages arrays and the user would have access. Note: the commands and packages were all objects that stored a lot of information on how to run, how to install, and various other stuff.</p>
        
        <h3>LinEmu</h3>
        <p>As stated above, LinEmu became the working name of the online project. For several months I worked on it, fine tuning it, and making the package installer work. Finally, after about 3 months, I got to work on the filesystem. Now, this was the hardest part. Obviously, I didn't have a physical filesystem to work with, so I had to get creative. I began my work on the <code>File</code> class, the <code>Directory</code> class, and the filesystem class, which I've already forgotten the name of. The filesystem got pushed back constantly, and was never fully completed, but I did manage to get it somewhat working. Nested directories, text files, and the general filesystem all did get completed, but there wasn't a good text editor working, and so once a file was created it couldn't be modified. I never finished that.</p>
        
        <h3>The Birth of ASOS</h3>
        <p>All of this is well and good, but what about ASOS? Well, after I got to working on LinEmu on my own laptop (the school I got sent to didn't appreciate me programming on their computers), I began working towards a real filesystem. This wasn't too bad. I took an existing filesystem simulator written in Java and got it working in Python. It took me a long time, several weeks, to port the code over, but once I finally got it and tested it, I moved it into LinEmu to work as the filesystem for that. This did mean that all of my classes for the filesystem had to be modified, but that wasn't a problem. About this time, I started realising that a huge code rewrite would be necessary to make it work as Linux does. At this point, I also gave up on ASOS (at that time, a real OS), and had just abandoned it altogether. Then I had an idea: what if I started with an OS simulator instead of an OS? That is the point where LinEmu took over for ASOS. I changed the name and got to work.</p>
        
        <h3>ASOS</h3>
        <p>There isn't much left to discuss about ASOS, it is almost abandoned, but not quite. However, the development on it hit a huge halt. With the idea of ASOS being a proper OS simulator, it made sense to prepare for when graphics would be added. And, of course, I wanted to make the codebase fit the idea, so a lot of code got shuffled around and I started splitting everything up: bootloader and kernel, filesystem... It all got shuffled and moved. Finally, I was almost ready. There was just one problem: I wanted ASOS to run like a VM would, so it needed a graphics library. I didn't want anything too fancy, though, because it simply needed to exist in a window environment. That ruled out Qt5. I decided to mess around with a Python built-in, <code>tkinter</code>. This didn't go as planned and actually pushed the development back further, to the point I am at now. There is no development going on right now because I am fighting with Tkinter to allow myself to make a proper widget to handle what I am looking for. Sadly, it isn't as easy as I had hoped.</p>
        
        <h3>Final Word</h3>
        <p>So long as ASOS is being developed, ApplesOS will be on hold while I learn theory. However, ASOS is currently on hold due to limitations in Tkinter. I want an OS Simulator that can be run with all of the libraries and modules packaged with it, which leaves me with Tkinter. Perhaps in the future I will change this requirement.
        
        One final note: oddly enough, ASOS is also short for A Simple OS Simulator, which was not the intended meaning.</p>
