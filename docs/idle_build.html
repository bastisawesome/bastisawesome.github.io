        <h1>Idle Build</h1>
        <p>Idle build is my first and last attempt at an idle game. It has undergone three massive code-base rewrites, finally settling on a JSON-based game object and a JS parser. This project is actually one of my biggest web achievements as it taught me my current standard for making web games, primarily having all of the HTML rendering done in JS loops, parsing the objects to generate the displays. While not efficient, it at least helps prevent the tedium of standard web design and allows me to focus more on the game than anything else.</p>
        
        <h3>The Future of Idle Build</h3>
        <p>Idle Build is an abandoned project. I have no intentions of reviving or updating the game. It will remain on my website as a show of legacy code and because it is the backend of a potential game, based entirely on the premise of Idle Build, but being completely interactive and having the player actually take part in the game.</p>
