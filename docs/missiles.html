        <h1>Missile Dodge</h1>
        <p>Missile Dodge was the first "real" web game I worked on. It wasn't designed to be an idle game at all and was started as a bridge into further web game projects. Missile Dodge was also a JS port of a Python game (which I deleted) by the same name, which was also coded by me. All assets used in the web version are the same as the Python version, with the exception of the clouds, which were made by a friend of mine specifically for the web version. The missile sprites were also slightly modified, as image manipulation with JS is difficult and I wanted a functional game sooner.</p>
        
        <h3>The Future of Missile Dodge</h3>
        <p>Oddly enough, there is a future to Missile Dodge! I have revived the project and do plan on continuing work on it. Currently, though, the future doesn't look very good and most likely it will never be fully complete, but simply a small game that I update enough to make playable and then just drop it there. Perhaps it will be my goto when I don't know what else to work on, but all I know for certain is that once I get it to the state that the Python version left off in, I don't intend to make it a priority.</p>
