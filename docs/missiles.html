        <h1>Missile Dodge</h1>
        <p>Missile Dodge was the first "real" web game I worked on. It wasn't designed to be an idle game at all and was started as a bridge into further web game projects. Missile Dodge was also a JS port of a Python game (which I deleted) by the same name, which was also coded by me. All assets used in the web version are the same as the Python version, with the exception of the clouds, which were made by a friend of mine specifically for the web version. The missile sprites were also slightly modified, as image manipulation with JS is difficult and I wanted a functional game sooner.</p>
        
        <h3>The Future of Missile Dodge</h3>
        <p>Missile Dodge is yet another abandoned project, which served only as a basis for learning web gaming. I did have intentions to complete it to the extent that the Python version was, and maybe even add some new features that I had planned for a long time but never finished. As it stands, there is no intention to come back to it and update the game.</p>
