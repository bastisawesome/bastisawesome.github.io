<ul class='betterList'>
    <li>V2.0.0 ALPHA - [DATE]</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Content:</li>
	<li>Another complete overhaul of the game. This update completely overwrites all upgrades! Unfortunately, this does require a complete
	wipe of the save data.</li>
	<li>Upgrades are now split into sections: clicker, tier, and boosts.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
	<li>UI:</li>
	<li>There are now sections for each upgrade type.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
	<li>Bug Fixes:</li>
	<li>Fixes tier upgrades so they finally work correctly!</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Known Bugs:</li>
    </ul>
    <li>V1.0.0 ALPHA - [DATE]</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Content:</li>
        <li>Pretty much a complete overhaul of the game, which means another save wipe... Sorry about that. Hopefully I will remember that there are changes I can make that don't require wiping your saves.</li>
        <li>Added tin ore and copper ore as well as a tier system to obtain them. They are sellable.</li>
        <li>Changed smelteries so they can now be upgraded to smelt each ore as part of the tier system.<li>
        <li>Changed mines so they also run with the tier system and can mine various ores.</li>
        <li>With the addition of tiered ores many upgrades have now lost their efficiency.</li>
        <li>Random events work with the tier system with mines. Yay!</li>
        <li>Re-implemented boosts for all buildings that it was removed from! I admit, this was un-noticeable except to me, but it still counts.</li>
        <li>Mining speed is directly related to the resource, meaning that when the player mines the amount of material that increases is likely to be dependent on any purchased upgrades.</li>
        <li>All processed ores are manually unsellable. Hurray for upgrading the stores! Oh wait... On top of that, due to some changes I made with the code there is now only one store that is necessary. This means that you no longer need to focus on three different stores. This also means that you have to be careful with the only store.</li>
        <li>New hardware store boosts! With the removal of other stores comes the upgrades that make your resources technically more valuable! (note: this does NOT use up more resources)</li>
        <li>With the balancing I attempted to do this time, a lot of prices have changed.</li>
        <li>Added a ton of new upgrades with a new total of: [NUM OF UPGS]</li>
        <li>Added another [NUM] random events.</li>
        <li>Add a (hidden) timer that keeps track of how long you have been playing.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>UI:</li>
        <li>Currently know additions to the user interface... I am sure that is a slight oversight and will be rectified soon.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
        <li>There was apparently a misspelled 'an' in there that was spelled 'and'. Thanks to my only IRL friend, Joseph, for spotting it for me so I could fix it.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Known Bugs:</li>
        <li>Still missing achievements for some reason... I should keep looking into that bug. It's gotta be around here somewhere...</li>
        <li>Prices may be adjusted. I did modifications using multiple runs through the game to try to get a good number.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Secrets:</li>
        <li>Introducing...!<br/>A new secret inside of an unimplemented section! Yay! *confetti and music*</li>
    </ul>
    <li>V1.0.0 ALPHA - 1/2/2016</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Content:</li>
        <li>Added random events. YAY!</li>
        <li>Added 21 of different random events.</li>
        <li>Added coal. Clicking now has a low chance of gaining coal.</li>
        <li>Changed smelteries to use coal, which currently only comes from clicking. (yes, there is a reason to be active)</li>
        <li>Changed steel mills to use coal.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>UI</li>
        <li>Added a place for random events to generate</li>
        <li>Fixed some really large gaps of whitespace that were bothering me. They've been removed!</li>
        <li>Events display with random messages!</li>
        <li>Added descriptions to buildings and upgrades.</li>
        <li>Added display names for upgrades. This allows for me to have an easy to identify object basis for upgrades but still look pretty to the players.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
        <li>One fix that wasn't technically a bug but is a hidden change that is probably easy to find for someone who can read my horribly-written code.</li>
        <li>While not technically a bug, I did go through some code and modify it so that the game is much easier to handle and expand.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Known Bugs:</li>
        <li>Still some display bugginess but I won't mess with it until the huge bug fix release.</li>
        <li>Really frustrating glitch I found, and fixed, that caused the mining button to not call the new click function. The fix, however, should not be necessary and I hate to use JS to set HTML element attributes. I hate HTML.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Secrets:</li>
        <li>There is a small display secret to be found. If you find it, bully! Hint: Why do I get the feeling it's in the kitchen? (it's not really)</li>
        <li>There is another secret in the code, one much easier to find. Hint: Adam once told her to burn to death because he was too evil to let her stop it. (the game was probably the worst I have ever played, considering it is from my favourite series)</li>
        <li>There is a secret in the same place as the first that is a bit more subtle. Hint: *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*</li>
    </ul>
